# Lab 3: 21-Aug

	Question:

	Processing of commands with `pipes` and `fork`

	Write a program that will read a command from a user and execute them. The program should exit
	if the user enters a special command called "quit" or "exit". The program should use pipes
	to communicate between parent and child processes to implement the desired functionality.

To compile:
```gcc Prgm-1.c -o prgm-1-out```

To execute:
```./prgm-1-out```
